## How To Play
* Move the Player Character **A** by pressing
  * **A** or the **left arrow key** for moving left
  * **D** or the **right arrow key** for moving right
  * **space bar** to shoot
* Collect PowerUPs for special effects like
  * increasing you health
  * shooting more bullets
* Shoot the alien ships **Y** up your score.  
The value of the alien ships increases per level.
* If you are hit by an enemy bullet, you loose one health.  
* In case your health drops to zero or the aliens reach the bottom of the playing field, it's game over.  
You will have to start all over again.
* De-/Activate the **automation** by pressing **S**
